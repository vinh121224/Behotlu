<h2 style="color: white;">There are several times throughout the main story questline that Geralt (or Ciri) will face off against the captains of the Wild Hunt. There's the soldier Nithral, the hulking Imlerith, the mage-like navigator Caranthir and finally the King of the Wild Hunt himself, Eredin.</h2>

<h2 style="color: white;">The King of Wolves is a fairly early boss fight that you'll have to tackle while playing as Ciri. As the name suggests, he is a terrifying werewolf. This is actually the first real boss you'll encounter as Ciri in the game and happens at the beginning of Act I.</h2>

<h2 style="color: white;"> regret to inform Your Grace that Your Grace's son fell while hunting a fiend. He died on the spot, along with his squire, his guide, the beaters, his peasant entourage and his hounds.
    – Kavin Jell, manager of the Villepin Estate near Vizima
    Fiends are walking mountains of muscle capped with horned, tooth-filled heads. Like their rarer cousins, bumbakvetches, they live in thick forests, swamps and bogs. When possible they avoid humans, but when not possible, they kill them, and without much difficulty.</h2>

<h2 style="color: white;">The Ice Giant known as Myrhyff is actually an optional boss but one that most players encounter since playing all of the quests is one of the best parts of The Witcher 3. Myrhyff is a very difficult fight if you're not prepared. Make sure you have Ogroid Oil and be prepared to use Quen quite a bit. There is a way to avoid fighting him if you're sneaky enough.</h2>

<h2 style="color: white;">The Royal Griffin is the first official monster boss you will fight at the end of the prologue in White Orchard. It is part of the "Beast of White Orchard" quest, which is technically a contract but counts as a main quest as well. Geralt and Vesemir will spend a great deal of time prepping to fight the Griffin by finding buckthorn and learning everything they can about the creature.</h2>
